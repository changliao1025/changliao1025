### What's new

HexWatershed produces the world's first flow direction map for the Antarctic using the MPAS mesh.

* 2024-06-15 I gave a talk in the â€˜Advanced Computational Methods for Climate Modeling and Analysisâ€™ session in the ESCO 2024 - 9th European Seminar on Computing ESCO2024. This talk focuses on the km-scale river routing modeling in ESM.

* 2024-05-15 I gave a workshop â€˜Mesh independent flow direction modeling using HexWatershed 3.0â€™ in the CSDMS annual meeting at Montclair State University CSDMS 2024.

### Introduction

I am an Earth Scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).

My research mainly focuses on high-resolution Earth system modeling at both regional and global scales.

I wrote casual articles at https://changliao.github.io/

I developed models and tools to understand Earth's system.
